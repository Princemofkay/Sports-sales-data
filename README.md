Analysis
The most profitable state for online sports sales is California. This is due to the state's large population, high disposable incomes, and strong sports culture. Other profitable states include Texas, Florida, and New York.
Monthly revenue and profit from online sports sales tend to increase in the summertime (in the US), peaking in April at the beginning of the summer season. This is because consumers are more likely to spend money on sports products during the holidays.
